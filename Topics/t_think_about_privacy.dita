    <title>Think about privacy</title>
    <shortdesc>You often need to take a screenshot of a page that contains confidential information
        such as account identifications, income data or personal info. Make sure to mask, modify, or
        remove any personal identifiers, passwords, logins, or other information that could
        compromise security.</shortdesc>

            <p>Ð•ven when we take a screenshot to send it to a friend, we have to be aware of what we
                are doing to avoid awkward situations like showing people too many opened browser
                tabs, or how your music player is stuck on the new One Direction album. See, even
                then we have privacy concerns. The situation gets more serious when taking
                screenshots is part of your job, and revealing some sensitive information could harm
                the business or its reputation.</p>
            <p>You often need to take a screenshot of a page that contains confidential information
                such as account identifications, income data or personal info. Make sure to mask,
                modify, or remove any personal identifiers, passwords, logins, or other information
                that could compromise security.</p>
            <p>Basically, all information considered PII or SPII should be hidden. If a source
                screenshot includes PII/SPII, hide it with a solid-color overlay with 100% opacity.
                Don't rely on blurs, mosaic effects, or similar image-processing effects to obscure
                PII. They may look better on your screenshot; however such effects can be reversed
                to reveal the original information.</p>
            <p>If you're exporting an image to a format that can include information on separate
                layers (for example, PDF or TIFF), flatten the image on export.</p>
