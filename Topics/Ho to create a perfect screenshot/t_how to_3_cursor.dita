            <p>Make sure your mouse cursor is not visible in your screenshots. The best way to hide
                the cursor is to choose a screenshot app that turns your cursor into a frame-drawing
                tool. In that case, there will be no visible pointer on the screen. If you use a
                standard shortcut, the cursor will most likely appear in the shot.</p>
