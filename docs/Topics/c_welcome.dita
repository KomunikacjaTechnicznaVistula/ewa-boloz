        <p>A picture is worth a thousand words.We all take pictures of our screen from time to time
            because it is often the fastest way to show and explain something. </p>
        <p>But, when making screenshots is part of your working process - this is a totally
            different thing. Taking pictures for documentation that really worth it is not always
            easy. You have to think about many things when making screenshots - image size, image
            quality, information privacy, text readabilityâ€¦ </p>
        <p>The main idea behind this project is to show you how to create great informative
            screenshots that will save you and your readers a lot of time and learning efforts.</p>
